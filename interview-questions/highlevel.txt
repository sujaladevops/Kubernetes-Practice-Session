1.What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
Docker is a container platform, where as Kubernetes is a container orchestration environment that offers capabilities like 
Auto healing, Auto Scaling, Clustering and Enterprise Level support like Load Balancing.


2. What are the main components of Kubernetes Architecture?
On a broad level, it can be divide kubernetes components into two parts.
i. Control Plane
   a. API Server:  This is the central point of communication for interacting with the cluster. 
        Users and other components send requests to the API server to manage workloads and access cluster information.
   b. Kube Scheduler: IThis component assigns pods to nodes in the cluster based on various factors like resource availability, pod requirements, and affinity/anti-affinity rules.
   c. ETCD: This is a distributed key-value store that stores the current state of the cluster, including the desired state of applications, their running pods, and configuration data. 
   d. Controller Manager: This runs multiple controllers, each responsible for managing specific aspects of the cluster, such as deployments, replicasets, and nodes.
      C-CM: Cloud Controller Manager: This is for any of the Cloud(AKS, EKS)
ii. Data Plane
    a. Kubelet: This agent on each node communicates with the API server and ensures pods are running according to the desired state. 
       It manages containers, downloads container images, and reports back to the control plane.
    b. Container Runtime: This software actually runs the containers on the node. Popular options include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
    c. Kube-proxy: responsible for maintaining network connectivity between services and pods within the cluster. It acts as a network proxy on each node, ensuring smooth communication between pods across different nodes and between services exposed outside the cluster.  

3. What are the differenes between Docekr Swarm and Kubernetes?
   Kubernetes is a standard and suited for large Organizations as it offers more scalability, networking capabilities like
   policies and huge third party  ecosystem support.

4. What is the difference between Docker container and Kubernetes Pod?
   A pod in kubernetes is a runtime specification of a container in docker. A pod provides more declarative way of defining using
   YAML files and we can run more than one container in a pod.
